## API Used

https://api-ninjas.com/api/recipe - Used to pull and list 10 recipes when the user searches for a recipe

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to be able to search for recipes and save them to your own digital cookbook. When on the homepage, you're able to search for recipes based on what is entered, and when you search, a list of 10 recipes will populate. If there is a recipe that you like, you can click the save button and it will save to your own personal cookbook, which is located on another page. When viewing your personal cookbook, it will only display recipes that you have saved as well as recipes that are custom submitted. Users are able to submit their own recipes to the cookbook in order to have as full of a cookbook as possible for the user. Alternatively, if you want something completely new, there is a randomizer page that will generate a random recipe that you may make. It will only display one random recipe and display an image of that recipe that you may print out and save for future use.
